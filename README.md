# Algorithm
- Median of Two Sorted Arrays of diffrent size. Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. Example Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2] Output: 2.00000 Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

- list Of Two Some is an algorithm to find all the pairs of two integers in an unsorted array that sum up to a given target. For example, if the array is [3, 5, 2, -4, 8, 11] and the sum is 7, your program should return [[11, -4], [2, 5]] because 11 + -4 = 7 and 2 + 5 = 7.
