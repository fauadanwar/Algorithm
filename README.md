# Algorithm
- Median of Two Sorted Arrays of diffrent size. Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays. Example Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2] Output: 2.00000 Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

- list Of Two Some is an algorithm to find all the pairs of two integers in an unsorted array that sum up to a given target. For example, if the array is [3, 5, 2, -4, 8, 11] and the sum is 7, your program should return [[11, -4], [2, 5]] because 11 + -4 = 7 and 2 + 5 = 7.

- Bracket Combinations contains functions to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses from given number n. 
  1. A function to return total number of parentheses 
  2. A fucntion to return String generated from number of parentheses. 
  3. A funciton to check if parenthesis are in right order. 
  4. A function to check if a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']'  is valid or not.

- Min Window Substring take the first parameter being the string N and the second parameter being a string K of some characters, and goal is to determine the smallest substring of N that contains all the characters in K. For example: if strArr is ["aaabaaddae", "aed"] then the smallest substring of N that contains the characters a, e, and d is "dae" located at the end of the string. So for this example program should return the string dae.

- Longest Word find longest word in string.

- Factorial take the num parameter being passed and return the factorial of it. 
example: if num = 4, then your program should return (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 24. For the test cases, the range will be between 1 and 18 and the input will always be an integer.

- Reverse Array reverses an Array of generic type.

- Merge Sorted Array merge two sorted array. Ex. first array = [1,3,4,6,10] second array = [2,5,7,8,9] and result = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

- Merge Array sequential merge two array sequentially by taking one element from each array at a time. Ex. firstArray [1,4,2,3], secondArray: [5,10,7,8,9] result: [1, 5, 4, 10, 2, 7, 3, 8, 9]
